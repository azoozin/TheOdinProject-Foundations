<h2>Description</h2>
<p>A lasagna dish is a classic Italian casserole made with layers of wide flat pasta, a savory meat sauce, and a creamy
    b√©chamel or ricotta cheese sauce. The pasta is typically boiled until al dente, then layered with the sauces and
    grated cheese, such as mozzarella or Parmesan. </p>
<p>The dish is then baked until the cheese is melted and bubbly, and the flavors have melded together. Lasagna is a
    hearty and satisfying meal that can be made with a variety of fillings, including vegetables, seafood, or different
    types of meat.</p>
